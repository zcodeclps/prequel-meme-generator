# prequel-meme-generator

The basic idea is to think of a situation, pick the "emotion" that best describes the situation, and out comes a meme.
 
Right now, the make feature is the only one that works.
The text file contains what is needed to load the memes into the program with the format of:

<filename>
<movie quote>
<emotion> <emotion> <emotion> ...
